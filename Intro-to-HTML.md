HTML is a markup language. It tells the web browser how to structure and display content. 


##Tags

HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to different types of content. Elements are enclosed by opening and closing tags. Tags are short pieces of text indicating the type of content enclosed, surrounded by angle brackets (`<>`). The closing tag looks just like the opening tag except it has a forward slash (`/`) after the first angle bracket.

For example, the line below contains a block of text surrounded by paragraph (p) tags, meant to tell the browser that the line should be interpreted as a paragraph.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
