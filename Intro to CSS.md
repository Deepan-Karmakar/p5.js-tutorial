#CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is used to tell web browsers how to style and display HTML-structured text. While HTML defines the content and structure, CSS supplies the form and style. Separating the content from the style makes the code easier to read and also allows us to more easily swap out one style for another.

###Inline styling

You can set style properties inline using the style attribute. Inside the quotes, you place one or more property:value pairs, separated by semicolons.
```html
<p style="width:400px; background:#FF0000; font-size: 18px;">This is some text.</p>
```

You can find all css style attributes in this [CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
