Similar to [openframeworks-project generator](https://github.com/ofZach/project-creator) and [cinder-tinderbox](https://github.com/cinder/TinderBox-Mac), this app will create a directory with all dependencies (html, css, js, etc.) required for a p5.js project.

#### [p5.js seed project](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/p5js-seed)
