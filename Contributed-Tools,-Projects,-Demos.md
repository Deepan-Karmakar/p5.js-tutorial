### [p5.js seed project](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/p5js-seed)
You can use this project to quickly bootstrap your p5js project and a supporting dev environment. The seed contains a basic p5js application and is pre-configured to install the p5js framework and a bunch of development tools such as a simple server and live-reload.
