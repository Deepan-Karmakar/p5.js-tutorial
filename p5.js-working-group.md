# Ideas

## What is open source?
* How do we explain open source? How do we communicate this? Could we make a short video? 
* Inspiration: Luisa Pereira's [Inside p5](http://www.luisapereira.net/teaching/looking-inside-p5/) videos.

## "Examples for _________"
![](http://i.imgur.com/prVcful.png)
* Set of p5.js examples/tutorial that are specifically geared toward an activist audience.
* Inspiration: Jen Kagan's [Intro to coding for activists](http://kaganjd.github.io/p5-at-amc/).
* Useful: Atul Varma's [p5 widget](https://toolness.github.io/p5.js-widget/) for embedding examples in a page.
