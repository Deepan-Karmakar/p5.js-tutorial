##The Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents. Meaning, it provides a way to use code (JavaScript, for example) to access and modify the structure, style, and content of an HTML page (the document).

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. Each of these objects has a set of properties and methods. A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element). A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).
