p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of [Processing](http://processing.org)—to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners—and reinterprets this for today's web.

Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has [addon libraries](http://p5js.org/libraries/) that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

p5.js is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port, and it is in active development. You can also read how this [differs from processing.js](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js#questions), or about how this [relates to Processing](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Processing-transition).

##Hello world

Please see the [get started](http://p5js.org/get-started/) page for instructions for setting up your editing environment and project.

There are two main functions you will use in your program. The `setup()` block runs once, and is typically used for initialization, or for creating a program that does not need a loop running code repeatedly. The `draw()` block runs repeatedly, and is used for animation.

For your first "Hello World" program, create a `setup()` block and add one line:

```javascript
function setup() {
  line(15, 25, 70, 90);
}
```

If you view this in your browser, you should see a single line. 

Adding a `draw()` block enables you to incorporate animation. In the example below, a variable is updated every time `draw()` runs, moving a circle across the screen.

```javascript
var x = 0;

function setup() {
  background(100);  
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(x, height/2, 20, 20);
  x = x + 1;
}
```

There is a full set of 2D drawing methods, to create and styles graphics, text, and images. See the [reference](http://p5js.org) for the full listing, and the [learn page](http://p5js.org/learn/#examples) for examples.

##createCanvas

By default, the drawing canvas has a size of 100x100. If you want to set a custom size, use the `createCanvas()` function. It is a good idea to always make this the first line in `setup()`. The code below sets the canvas to size 600x400:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  line(15, 25, 70, 90);
}
```

`createCanvas()` will create a new drawing canvas in the size specified and append it to the html page you are working with. If there is other content in the body of your html page, it will add on to the page after that, so you may not see it at the top of the window. 

The canvas will also be affected by any existing css (styling) on the page, including default set by your browser. For example, a lot of browsers have a default padding around the end of the page. If you are noticing that your canvas isn't all the way at the upper left corner of your window, this is probably why. To fix this, you can add a line to the `<head>` of your html file that overrides the default padding, like this:

```html
<style> body{padding:0; margin:0;} </style>
```

If you would like to specify a location for the canvas, rather than appending directly to the end, you can use the `parent()` method. In the `<body>` of your html file, create a container where you would like your canvas to get inserted, with ID of your choice:

```html
<div id='myContainer'></div>
```

Then use a variable to store a pointer to the canvas you created, and call `.parent()` on this variable:

```javascript
function setup() {
  var myCanvas = createCanvas(600, 400);
  myCanvas.parent('myContainer');
}
```

##Mouse and touch interaction

p5.js has a set of methods for handling mouse and touch interaction. The list below shows how they relate conceptually.

mouse | touch
------------- | -------------
[mouseX](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseX)| [touchX](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touchX)
[mouseY](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseY)| [touchY](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touchY)
| | [touches[]](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touches[])
[mouseIsPressed](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseIsPressed)| |
[mousePressed()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mousePressed)| [touchStarted()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touchStarted)
[mouseMoved()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseMoved)| |
[mouseDragged()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseDragged)| [touchMoved()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touchMoved)
[mouseReleased()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseReleased)| [touchEnded()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/touchEnded)
[mouseClicked()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseClicked)| |
[mouseScrolled()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/mouseScrolled)| |

You may notice with touch, unless you have defined a `touchStarted()` method, the screen may react with default touch behavior for your mobile device (i.e. your whole screen view may move around when you drag your finger). If you add an empty `touchStarted()` method, you should see this stop.

##Asyncronous calls and file loading

JS is single threaded and synchronous, meaning one line of code completes before the next one runs. However, there are asynchronous functions used that make the program flow faster. Loading images, external files, and URLs are generally handled by async functions.

###Callbacks

All of the load functions will accept a callback function as an optional last argument. In the following example, an image is drawn once it is loaded.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 240);
  loadImage('cat.jpg', drawCat);
}

function drawCat(img) {
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

Compare this to calling `image()` directly after `loadImage()`, which ends up blank:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 240);
  var img = loadImage('cat.jpg');
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

###Preload

Alternatively, you could use the `preload()` function. If a `preload()` block exists it runs first, then `setup()` will wait until everything in there has completed before it gets run, so you can make use of things loaded in preload in setup and draw. Note that nothing else should be in preload besides load calls, all other initialization should happen in setup. No callbacks are required for load functions in preload.

```javascript
var img;
function preload() {
  img = loadImage('cat.jpg');
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 240);
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

##Browser functions and native JavaScript

There are a few variables and functions that make browser interaction easier, many more to come!

+ [windowWidth](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/windowWidth) / [windowHeight](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/windowHeight)
+ [displayWidth](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/displayWidth) / [displayHeight](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/displayHeight)
+ [winMouseX](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/winMouseX) / [winMouseY](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/winMouseY)
+ [fullscreen()](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/fullscreen)

You should also be able to use any native JS functions in your p5.js sketch without a problem, the [MDN JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a good place to learn more. Read the next section to learn how to make p5 play extra nice with the rest of your project.

##Instantiation / namespace

By default, all p5.js functions are in the global namespace (i.e. bound to the window object), meaning you can call them simply `ellipse()`, `fill()`, etc. However, this might be inconvenient if you are mixing with other JS libraries or writing long programs of your own. To solve this problem, there is something we call "instance mode", where all p5 functions are bound up in a single variable instead of polluting your global namespace.

Consider a program like this:

```javascript
var x = 100;
var y = 100;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,50,50);
}
```
A conversion to "instance mode" looks like this:

```javascript
var s = function( sketch ) {

  var x = 100; 
  var y = 100;

  sketch.setup = function() {
    sketch.createCanvas(700, 410);
  };

  sketch.draw = function() {
    sketch.background(0);
    sketch.fill(255);
    sketch.rect(x,y,50,50);
  };
};

var myp5 = new p5(s);
```

Optionally, you can specify a default container for the canvas and any other elements to append to with a second argument. You can give the ID of an element in your html, or an html node itself:

```var myp5 = new p5(s, 'myContainer');```

Note that creating instances like this also allows you to have more than one p5 sketch on a single web page, as they will each be wrapped up with their own set up variables. Of course, you could use iframes to have multiple sketches in global mode.

##Libraries

One of the core ideas behind p5.js is that your sketch is not just the graphics canvas but the whole web page in your browser. For this reason, there is the [p5.dom library](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) that makes it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, hyperlink, image, input, video, audio, and webcam. There is also a [p5.sound library](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) that provides a friendly interface to HTML5 web audio API for loading, playing, and synthesizing sounds.

Learn how to use these libraries or develop your own [here](http://p5js.org/libraries/).


##Editor

You can use any editing environment you like, in addition, a [p5.js editor](p5js.org/download/#editor) is in development, you can try out the alpha version now. The p5.js editor handles setting up projects and runs a local server for you. You can usually run p5.js sketches without a server, but it is required if you are doing certain things like loading external files. Here are instructions for [setting up a local server](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).
