Hi,

Great that you want to get involved! All discussion happens on the [github repository](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) over issue threads, feel free to comment on any that you have thoughts about. 

This document gives an overview of the development process:
github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Development

Any open issue is up for grabs, there's always general bug squashing that can be done. If you're interested on working on something a bit larger, let me know. Or I'd love to hear any ideas or specific interests you have.

Also, in NYC specifically there is a working group that meets up (regularly during the school year and sporadically during the summer). You can get on the list here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/p5xjs-working-group.

Welcome!
