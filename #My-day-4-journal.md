The fact that I figured out how to do THIS is all telling that I am starting to get things a bit more. 
I am frustrated with:
My slow computer
My EXTREMELY slow typing skills as far as finding the symbols and using them without looking.
It takes me a long time to just do the bare minimum of the assignments.

I am happy with:
The professionalism of this school!
Brian and the T.A.'s!!
That my brain is absorbing more that I thought it would. (Apparent during the first quiz)
That we can re-do assignments for points.
Each and every one of my classmates is super nice and helpful.
That we get all afternoon to work on assignments.
