## IDEs / learning

+ [Khan Academy Computer Science](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs)
+ [Studio Sketchpad](http://sketchpad.cc)
+ [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) - desktop editor allows realtime modification of running code

+ [paper.js editor](http://paperjs.org/static/editor/) 
+ [github.com/daniellmb/JavaScript-Scope-Context-Coloring](https://github.com/daniellmb/JavaScript-Scope-Context-Coloring) - Experiment in switching between syntax highlighting and scope colorizing built on JSLint and CodeMirror.
+ [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) - JavaScript component that provides a code editor in the browser. For supported languages, it will color your code, and optionally help with indentation. Also provides API and CSS theming system for customizing to fit your application, and extending it with new functionality.

+ [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) - free, open source version based on Mozilla XULRunner (like Firefox), comes with SpiderMonkey JS engine included and uses Scintilla as code editor
+ [ICE Coder](http://icecoder.net/) - pure browser IDE
+ [ACE editor](http://ace.ajax.org/)
+ [codebender](http://codebender.cc/) - arduino editor with sharing [github.com/codebendercc](https://github.com/codebendercc/)


## Processing/JavaScript + other languages
+ [Ruby-Processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing) - Ruby syntax but utilizes the ease of Processing for drawing
    + Uses regular Ruby for generating sketches, exporting applications and applets; and uses Java via JRuby for running Processing.
    + Supports live coding, includes a control panel.
    + Convenience method for searching through methods $app.find_method("ellipse") will return a list of the method names that may match what you’re looking for: “ellipse”, “ellipseMode”, and “ellipse_mode”.
    + Transliteration vs. translation (Despite the fact that the entire Processing API is available to you, it’s best to work in idiomatic Ruby as much as possible.)
    + [Ruby-Processing in practice](https://github.com/jashkenas/learning-processing-with-ruby)
+ [ofxJavaScript (running JS in OF)](https://code.google.com/p/ofxjavascript/)
    + Uses [Mozilla SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey). 
    + Exposes several classes of openframeworks library to Javascript, allows you to call C++ functions from Javascript, call Javascript functions from C++, or create your "own" Javascript classes.
    + [ofLiveCoding](https://code.google.com/p/oflivecoding)
+ [Ringo](http://ringojs.org) - (based on Rhino) runs JS on Java and adds "goodies"
+ [Ringo Java integration docs](http://ringojs.org/documentation/java_integration)

## JS creative coding libraries

+ [Plask](http://www.plask.org) - JS based creative coding env, Uses: V8, Skia, NodeJS, Cocoa & OpenGL, FreeImage, Syphon
+ [Plask on github](https://github.com/deanm/plask)
+ [two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/) - two-dimensional drawing api geared towards modern web browsers. It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to draw in multiple contexts: svg, canvas, and webgl. Aims to make the creation and animation of flat shapes easier and more concise, does not support text or image. Built in scene graph, animation loop, svg interpreter.
+ [paper.js](paperjs.org) - vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / DOM and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, largely compatible with Scriptographer
