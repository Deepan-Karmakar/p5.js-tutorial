## JS creative coding libraries

+ [Plask](http://www.plask.org) - JS based creative coding env, Uses: V8, Skia, NodeJS, Cocoa & OpenGL, FreeImage, Syphon
+ [Plask on github](https://github.com/deanm/plask)
+ [two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/) - two-dimensional drawing api geared towards modern web browsers. It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to draw in multiple contexts: svg, canvas, and webgl. Aims to make the creation and animation of flat shapes easier and more concise, does not support text or image. Built in scene graph, animation loop, svg interpreter.
+ [paper.js](paperjs.org) - vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / DOM and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, largely compatible with Scriptographer


## Processing / JavaScript + other languages
+ [Ruby-Processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing) - Ruby syntax but utilizes the ease of Processing for drawing
    + Uses regular Ruby for generating sketches, exporting applications and applets; and uses Java via JRuby for running Processing.
    + Supports live coding, includes a control panel.
    + Convenience method for searching through methods $app.find_method("ellipse") will return a list of the method names that may match what you’re looking for: “ellipse”, “ellipseMode”, and “ellipse_mode”.
    + Transliteration vs. translation (Despite the fact that the entire Processing API is available to you, it’s best to work in idiomatic Ruby as much as possible.)
    + [Ruby-Processing in practice](https://github.com/jashkenas/learning-processing-with-ruby)
+ [ofxJavaScript (running JS in OF)](https://code.google.com/p/ofxjavascript/)
    + Uses [Mozilla SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey). 
    + Exposes several classes of openframeworks library to Javascript, allows you to call C++ functions from Javascript, call Javascript functions from C++, or create your "own" Javascript classes.
    + [ofLiveCoding](https://code.google.com/p/oflivecoding)
+ [Ringo](http://ringojs.org) - (based on Rhino) runs JS on Java and adds "goodies"
    + allows use of any java class
    + [Ringo Java integration docs](http://ringojs.org/documentation/java_integration)
+ [quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) - processing + clojure
+ [python mode for processing](https://github.com/martinleopold/PythonMode)
+ [another processing in python lib](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py)
+ [coffeescript mode for processing](https://github.com/fjenett/coffeescript-mode-processing) 
+ [scala + processing](http://spde.technically.us/Spde.html)
