+ Drawing with multiple canvases.
+ Creating additional DOM elements (createElement, createImage).
+ Handling input for multiple elements, attaching listeners.
+ Setting style (with links to good CSS references).
+ Mixing in native JS and including other libraries (with links to good JS references).
+ Console / debugging, how to print and inspect an object.
