You likely started out with p5.js drawing graphics using the HTML5 canvas, a special element you can draw graphics into. However, p5.js can also be used to create and interact with HTML elements outside of the graphics canvas.

When you call ```createGraphics(w, h)``` you create a graphics canvas to draw into with the specified width and height. However, you can also keep a pointer to this canvas by storing it in a variable. With this pointer we can call methods of the element itself, to set the position, id or class, for instance. The position is relative to the upper left of the window.

```javascript
var canvas;

function setup() {

  // We are still calling createGraphics like in the past, but now we are storing the result as a variable.
  // This way we can call methods of the element, to set the position for instance.
  canvas = createGraphics(600, 400);

  // Here we call methods of each element to set the position and id, try changing these values.
  // Use the inspector to look at the HTML generated from this code when you load the sketch in your browser.
  canvas.position(300, 50);
  canvas.class("lemon");

}


function draw() {

  // These commands are applied to the graphics canvas as normal.
  background(220, 180, 200);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
  ellipse(width/4, height/2, 50, 50);

}
```

In addition to ```createGraphics(w, h)```, you can also add HTML elements directly using ```createHTML(html)```, which creates a DIV on the page with the given HTML. In the example below, a DIV with text is created, in addition to the graphics canvas, and the position is set for each.

```javascript
var text;
var canvas;

function setup() {
  text = createHTML("This is an HTML string!");
  canvas = createGraphics(600, 400);
  text.position(50, 50);
  canvas.position(300, 50);
}

function draw() {
  // These commands are applied to whichever element was most recently created.
  background(220, 180, 200);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
  ellipse(width/4, height/2, 50, 50);
}
```

Try switching the order of the createHTML and createGraphics lines. You notice that it breaks when you put them the other way. This is because the most the program tries to draw into the most recently created element. If you create the HTML element second, it doesn't make work to draw background and ellipse into it because drawing only works with graphics elements. In order to tell the program to draw into the canvas element, use the ```context(elt)``` function in draw, passing in the pointer to the element you want to draw into.

```javascript
var text;
var canvas;

function setup() {
  canvas = createGraphics(600, 400);
  text = createHTML("This is an HTML string!");

  text.position(50, 50);
  canvas.position(300, 50);
}

function draw() {
  // The program is set to draw into text because it was created last
  // but calling context tells the program to draw into canvas instead.
  context(canvas);
  background(220, 180, 200);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
  ellipse(width/4, height/2, 50, 50);
}
```


elements can have position() and id() (id is unique, only one element)
draw methods happen on whichever element was most recently created
17-1
can embed HTML within createHTML(), such as links
17-2
createHTMLImage() creates an <img>
context() tells p5.js which element to draw to
17-3
elements have mouseOver() and mouseOut() methods that let you bind functions to these events per element (these are not global now)
elements have hide() and show() methods
17-4
elements have mousePressed() methods that let you bind functions to this event per element
keyPressed() does not need to be bound, itâ€™s global
17-5
you can make more than one canvas!
use context() to switch which one you are drawing to
17-6
you can use context() and then call custom functions
17-7
elements can have a class() (multiple elements can share a class)
var donkeys = find('donkey')
find() finds all the elements with a class and returns them into an array
17-8
just like the inline CSS we showed you last week, you can use a style() function on any element and pass it an inline CSS string programmatically
