##Notes / considerations##
+ web developer tools
+ processing-js as entry point to web development
+ more transparent, more standard web structure
+ standard javascript - quasi auto complete, strict mode, viz of var scope, sequence
+ live, quasi-live coding environment, dev tools built in
+ standard javascript - quasi auto complete, strict mode, viz of var scope, sequence
+ standard javascript - quasi auto complete, strict mode, viz of var scope, sequence
+ also use processing methods
+ visually represent what's going on, in terms of inheritance
+ find in reference
+ not too cluttered
+ all the benefits, but executes like it's in the browser
