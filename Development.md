###Getting started

1. Download and install [npm](https://npmjs.org/).
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
3. Fork and clone this library. 
```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/processing-js.git
```
4. Navigate into the project folder and install dependencies via npm.
```
cd processing-js/
npm install
```
5. To create the dist library from src, run Grunt.
```
grunt
```

###Overview
```src/``` This directory contains all the source code for the library. The code is broken up into folders and files corresponding with the [Processing reference page](processing.org/reference/). Additionally, there is a core folder that holds constants, and internal helper functions and variables.

```dist/``` This directory contains the concatenated p5.js and p5.min.js libraries, generated by Grunt.

```examples/``` This directory contains code examples including a port of all of Dan Shiffman's [Learning Processing](learningprocessing.com), as well as an empty-empty example that demonstrates setting up a sketch, and examples related to specific [tutorials](https://github.com/lmccart/processing-js/wiki/Tutorials).
