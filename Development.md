###Getting started

Interested in contributing? Awesome! First, figure out what you'd like to do (a good place to start is the [issues list](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/issues)):

1. **Fix a bug** -- If it's not on the issues list, add it. If it's already on this issues list, assign it to yourself or comment on the issue indicating you're working on it. Go ahead and fix it and submit a PR (see below for instructions for getting set up for development). We are also in the process of adding unit tests and more inline documentation, so if the function you are fixing doesn't have these, please consider adding these as well. [Submit the change to the master branch.](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Development#master-branch-development)

2. **Implement a new feature(s)** -- First, write to [lauren](mailto:laurmccarthy@gmail.com) or [evelyn](mailto:evhan55@gmail.com) to let us know you're interested! If it's not on the issues list, add it. If it's already on this issues list, assign it to yourself or comment on the issue indicating you're working on it. [Submit the change to the development branch.](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Development#development-branch-development) __Note: new features will require tests and inline documentation!__
    - JS Style guide:
        - We recommend looking at [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/) for a JS style guide
    - Inline documentation:
        - [Style guide for p5.js inline docs](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Inline-documentation) -- by formatting your documentation correctly, it will automatically show up in the p5.js reference (coming soon).
    - Unit tests:
        - See the [testing section](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Development#wiki-testing) for how to do this.
        - This helps ensure that the code you write keeps working far into the future when further updates and changes are made.

3. **Add unit tests or documentation for existing code**
    - [Style guide for p5.js inline docs](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Inline-documentation) -- by formatting your documentation correctly, it will automatically show up in the p5.js reference (coming soon).
    - See the [testing section](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Development#wiki-testing) for how to add unit tests.

4. **Contribute in some other way** -- Write to [lauren](mailto:laurmccarthy@gmail.com) or [evelyn](mailto:evhan55@gmail.com) and let us know what you're thinking! It is our intention that there should be many ways to contribute to p5.js, from writing code, to creating examples, tutorials and documentation, to thinking about workshops and education, to working on branding and design, and anything else you can dream up. Get in touch and we can talk about ways you might participate.

5. **Join the conversation** - On IRC/Freenode: **#p5js**

###Setup

1. Download and install [npm](https://npmjs.org/). The easiest way to do this is to just install [node](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
3. [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this library. 
```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/p5.js.git`
```
4. Navigate into the project folder and install dependencies via npm.
```
cd p5.js/ npm install
```
5. To create the library from src, run Grunt. 
```
grunt
```
6. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

###Overview

`lib/` Contains the concatenated p5.js and p5.min.js libraries, generated by Grunt.

`src/` Contains all the source code for the library. The code is broken up into folders and files corresponding with the [Processing reference page](http://processing.org/reference/). Additionally, there is a core folder that holds constants, and internal helper functions and variables.

`tests/` Contains unit testing files.

`examples/` Contains code examples including a port of all of Dan Shiffman's [Learning Processing](learningprocessing.com), as well as an empty-empty example that demonstrates setting up a sketch, and examples related to specific [tutorials](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Tutorials).

`api.md` Contains most up to date record of everything implemented. PLEASE UPDATE THIS IF YOU CHANGE THE API!

`api-progress.md` Contains the status of the API, including implemented, removed, still to do.

###Testing

With all new functions implemented, please include unit tests and inline documentation. A good example for how to format and write inline documentation can be seen in [PImage](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/src/image/image.js). Examples of unit tests can be found in the [test/unit](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/tree/master/test/unit) directory. Directions for adding your own tests and including them are below.

The testing is done with [grunt-mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha) which uses [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) test framework with [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). 
To get started:

1. Install dependencies.
```
cd p5.js/
npm install
```

2. Add test files corresponding to files in `src` (more info about Chai assert style TDD phrasing [here](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)). 
3. Link to the src and test files in `test.html`. 
4. Run the tests with `grunt mocha`.

### Master branch development

Develop on the `master` branch if you are applying hotfixes to the **current API**.

1. Fork p5.js
2. Make local changes
3. Commit and push changes
4. Submit a PR against the `p5.js/master` branch

### Development branch development

Develop on the `development` branch if you are making significant **API changes**.

1. Clone p5.js
2. Checkout the 'development' branch for local development
   `git checkout -b development origin/development`
3. Make changes
3. Commit and push changes
4. Submit a PR against the `p5.js/development`
