###Getting started

1. Download and install [npm](https://npmjs.org/).
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
3. Fork and clone this library. 
```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/p5.js.git
```
4. Navigate into the project folder and install dependencies via npm.
```
cd p5.js/
npm install

5. To create the dist library from src, run Grunt.
```
grunt
```

###Overview

`dist/` Contains the concatenated p5.js and p5.min.js libraries, generated by Grunt.

`src/` Contains all the source code for the library. The code is broken up into folders and files corresponding with the [Processing reference page](http://processing.org/reference/). Additionally, there is a core folder that holds constants, and internal helper functions and variables.

`libs/` Contains additional library dependencies for p5.js.

`tests/` Contains unit testing files.

`examples/` Contains code examples including a port of all of Dan Shiffman's [Learning Processing](learningprocessing.com), as well as an empty-empty example that demonstrates setting up a sketch, and examples related to specific [tutorials](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Tutorials).

`api.md` Contains most up to date record of everything implemented. PLEASE UPDATE THIS IF YOU CHANGE THE API!

`api-progress.md` Contains the status of the API, including implemented, removed, still to do.

###Testing

The testing is done with [grunt-mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha) which uses [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) test framework with [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). 
To get started:
```
cd p5.js/
npm install
```

Add test files corresponding to files in `src`. Link to the src and test files in `test.html`.
