### Download / File setup

Download the processing.js file and create a new index.html file and a new sketch.js file. You want to link to pjs.js and your sketch.js file in the head of the html file.

Example index.html file:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="pjs.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Alternatively, you can [download the whole project](https://github.com/lmccart/processing-js/archive/master.zip) and copy the example folder to any location you like and edit the sketch.js file.
